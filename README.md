# Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning

This project leverages the power of deep learning to recognize and classify emotions from speech signals. Harnessing state-of-the-art neural network architectures, our Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system analyzes audio data to accurately identify and categorize emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. With a focus on robustness and real-world applicability, our model has been trained on diverse datasets to ensure performance across various speaking styles and environments. Explore the world of emotion recognition in speech and contribute to the advancement of natural human-computer interaction.
